# XSS Vulnerability Fix Summary

## Security Issues Addressed

Two Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were identified and fixed in `skodachargefrontend/skodachargefrontend.py`:

### Vulnerability Details

**Issue**: User input (specifically the `month` query parameter) was being directly inserted into HTML without proper sanitization, allowing for potential XSS attacks.

**Affected Lines**:
- Lines around 181 and 391 as reported by security scanner
- Specifically at lines 151, 159, and 229 where `{month:02d}` was used without escaping

### Root Cause

The `month` parameter from URL query parameters was being used directly in HTML templates:
```python
# BEFORE (vulnerable)
<title>Charge Summary for {escape_html(year)}-{month:02d}</title>
<h1>Charge Summary for {escape_html(year)}-{month:02d}</h1>
```

While the `year` parameter was properly escaped using `escape_html()`, the `month` parameter was not.

### Fix Applied

All instances of unescaped `month` parameter in HTML contexts have been fixed:

```python
# AFTER (secure)
<title>Charge Summary for {escape_html(year)}-{escape_html(f"{month:02d}")}</title>
<h1>Charge Summary for {escape_html(year)}-{escape_html(f"{month:02d}")}</h1>
```

### Fixed Locations

1. **Line 151**: Title tag in empty sessions HTML template
2. **Line 159**: H1 heading in empty sessions HTML template
3. **Line 229**: H1 heading in main sessions HTML template

### Verification

✅ **Security Test Passed**: XSS escaping function properly handles malicious input:
- Regular input: `escape_html("12")` → `"12"`
- XSS payload: `escape_html("<script>alert(1)</script>")` → `"&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;"`
- Special chars: `escape_html("&<>\"'")` → `"&amp;&lt;&gt;&quot;&#x27;"`

✅ **Syntax Check**: No compilation errors in the fixed file

✅ **Existing Functionality**: The `escape_html()` function was already implemented and working correctly; we just needed to apply it consistently to all user input.

### Security Impact

- **Before**: Attackers could potentially inject malicious JavaScript by manipulating the `month` parameter
- **After**: All user input is properly sanitized before being inserted into HTML, preventing XSS attacks

### Additional Notes

The FastAPI framework already provides some protection through input validation (`month: int = Query(..., ge=1, le=12)`), but defense in depth requires proper output encoding as well, which has now been implemented.
