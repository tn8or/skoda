## How to Re-run GitHub Security Scans

After fixing security vulnerabilities, you may want to re-run GitHub's security scanning to verify that the issues have been resolved.

### Code Scanning Alerts

GitHub Code Scanning alerts are typically generated by CodeQL or other security analysis tools. To trigger a new scan:

1. **Automatic Triggers:**
   - Push new commits to the main branch
   - Create a pull request
   - The scan runs automatically on a schedule (usually daily)

2. **Manual Triggers:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to the "Security" tab
   - Click on "Code scanning alerts"
   - Look for a "Set up code scanning" or "Re-run" button if available
   - Alternatively, you can manually trigger workflows from the "Actions" tab

3. **Via GitHub Actions:**
   - If you have a CodeQL workflow in `.github/workflows/`, you can:
     - Go to the "Actions" tab
     - Select the CodeQL workflow
     - Click "Run workflow" to trigger it manually

### Secret Scanning

Secret scanning typically runs automatically and continuously. New pushes will trigger re-scans automatically.

### Dependency Scanning (Dependabot)

Dependabot security alerts are automatically updated when:
- New vulnerabilities are disclosed
- Dependencies are updated
- The repository is re-analyzed

## Recent XSS Fixes

The following XSS vulnerabilities have been addressed:

### Fixed in Previous Commit (bf54cb25126891af19b2fc7382fe40de6cc70e8a):
- Added `escape_html()` function for HTML escaping
- Escaped build metadata from environment variables
- Escaped database-derived content (position, mileage, timestamps)
- Added comprehensive XSS prevention tests

### Additional Fix in This Update:
- **Date formatting in daily totals:** Added escaping to `d.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')` output
- **Enhanced test coverage:** Added tests for date formatting and URL parameter safety

## Verification

To verify that XSS protections are working:

```bash
cd skodachargefrontend
python -m pytest tests/test_xss_prevention.py -v
```

All tests should pass, confirming that:
- HTML content is properly escaped
- Database content is sanitized
- Build metadata is safe from injection
- Date formatting is secure
- Navigation URLs are safe

## False Positive Considerations

If security scans still report XSS after these fixes, consider:

1. **Scanner lag:** Security scanning tools may take time to re-analyze the codebase
2. **False positives:** Automated tools sometimes flag safe code patterns
3. **Different branches:** Ensure the scan is running against the updated main branch
4. **Configuration:** Check if the scanning tool configuration needs updates

## Contact

If security alerts persist after implementing these fixes and allowing time for re-scanning, please review the specific alert details to determine if additional action is needed.
